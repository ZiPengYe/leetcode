## [#13 Roman to Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer)
Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.
```
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
```
For example, two is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. Twelve is written as, `XII`, which is simply `X` + `II`. The number twenty seven is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX` + `V` + `II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:
- `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9.
- `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90.
- `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.
Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer. Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: "III"
Output: 3
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: "IV"
Output: 4
```
**Example 3:**
```
Input: "IX"
Output: 9
```
**Example 4:**
```
Input: "LVIII"
Output: 58
Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.
```
**Example 5:**
```
Input: "MCMXCIV"
Output: 1994
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.

**Example 4:**
```
Input: ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.

## [#20 Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses)
Given a string containing just the characters `'('`, `')'`, `'{'`, `'}'`, `'['` and `']'`, determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:
  1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
  2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.

Note that an empty string is also considered valid.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: "()"
Output: true
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: "()[]{}"
Output: true
```
**Example 3:**
```
Input: "(]"

## [#26 Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array)
Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) such that each element appear only once and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array** [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) with O(1) extra memory.

**Example 1:**
```
Given nums = [1,1,2],

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4],

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being modified to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
```
**Clarification:**

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by reference, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

Internally you can think of this:
```cpp
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeElement(nums);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}
```

## [#27 Remove Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element)
Given an array nums and a value val, remove all instances of that value [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array** [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) with O(1) extra memory.

**Example 1:**
```
Given nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3,

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Given nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2,

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 1, 3, 0, and 4.

Note that the order of those five elements can be arbitrary.

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
```
**Clarification:**

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by reference, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

Internally you can think of this:
```cpp
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);

## [#28 Implement strStr()](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-strstr)
Implement [strStr()](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstring/strstr/).

Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.
**Example 1:**
```
Input: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"
Output: 2
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: haystack = "aaaaa", needle = "bba"
Output: -1
```
**Clarification:**

What should we return when `needle` is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.

For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when `needle` is an empty string. This is consistent to C's [strstr()](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstring/strstr/) and Java's [indexOf()](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#indexOf(java.lang.String)).

## [#38 Count and Say](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-and-say)
The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:
```
1.      1
2.      11
3.      21
4.      1211
5.      111221
```
`1` is read off as `"one 1"` or `11`.

`11` is read off as `"two 1s"` or `21`.

`21` is read off as `"one 2`, then `one 1"` or `1211`.

Given an integer *n* where 1 ≤ *n* ≤ 30, generate the *n*th term of the count-and-say sequence.

You can do so recursively, in other words from the previous member read off the digits, counting the number of digits in groups of the same digit.

Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: 1
Output: "1"
Explanation: This is the base case.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: 4
Output: "1211"
Explanation: For n = 3 the term was "21" in which we have two groups "2" and "1", "2" can be read as "12" which means frequency = 1 and value = 2, the same way "1" is read as "11", so the answer is the concatenation of "12" and "11" which is "1211".

## [#121 Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock)
Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

## [#122 Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii)
Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**
```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.

## [#160 Intersection of Two Linked Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists)
Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.

For example, the following two linked lists:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/13/160_statement.png)

begin to intersect at node c1.

**Example 1:**
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/13/160_example_1.png)
```
Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,0,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
Output: Reference of the node with value = 8
Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,0,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
```
**Example 2:**
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/13/160_example_2.png)
```
Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [0,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
Output: Reference of the node with value = 2
Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [0,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.
```
**Example 3:**
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/13/160_example_3.png)
```
Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
Output: null
Input Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.
```
**Notes:**
- If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return `null`.
- The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.
- You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.
- Your code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.

Input: 11111111111111111111111111111101
Output: 31
Explanation: The input binary string 11111111111111111111111111111101 has a total of thirty one '1' bits.
```
**Note:**
- Note that in some languages such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, the input will be given as signed integer type and should not affect your implementation, as the internal binary representation of the integer is the same whether it is signed or unsigned.
- In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using [2's complement notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement). Therefore, in **Example 3** above the input represents the signed integer `-3`.

If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?

## [#198 House Robber](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber)
You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
             Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: [2,7,9,3,1]
Output: 12
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
             Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.

## [#202 Happy Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number)
Write an algorithm to determine if a number `n` is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it **loops endlessly in a cycle** which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process **ends in 1** are happy numbers.

Return True if `n` is a happy number, and False if not.

**Example:**
```
Input: 19
Output: true
Explanation: 
1^2 + 9^2 = 82
8^2 + 2^2 = 68
6^2 + 8^2 = 100

## [#1024 Video Stitching](https://leetcode.com/problems/video-stitching)
You are given a series of video clips from a sporting event that lasted T seconds.  These video clips can be overlapping with each other and have varied lengths.

Each video clip clips[i] is an interval: it starts at time clips[i][0] and ends at time clips[i][1].  We can cut these clips into segments freely: for example, a clip [0, 7] can be cut into segments [0, 1] + [1, 3] + [3, 7].

Return the minimum number of clips needed so that we can cut the clips into segments that cover the entire sporting event ([0, T]).  If the task is impossible, return -1.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: clips = [[0,2],[4,6],[8,10],[1,9],[1,5],[5,9]], T = 10
Output: 3
Explanation:
We take the clips [0,2], [8,10], [1,9]; a total of 3 clips.
Then, we can reconstruct the sporting event as follows:
We cut [1,9] into segments [1,2] + [2,8] + [8,9].
Now we have segments [0,2] + [2,8] + [8,10] which cover the sporting event [0, 10].
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: clips = [[0,1],[1,2]], T = 5
Output: -1
Explanation:
We can't cover [0,5] with only [0,1] and [0,2].
```
**Example 3:**
```
Input: clips = [[0,1],[6,8],[0,2],[5,6],[0,4],[0,3],[6,7],[1,3],[4,7],[1,4],[2,5],[2,6],[3,4],[4,5],[5,7],[6,9]], T = 9
Output: 3
Explanation:
We can take clips [0,4], [4,7], and [6,9].
```
**Example 4:**
```
Input: clips = [[0,4],[2,8]], T = 5
Output: 2
Explanation:
Notice you can have extra video after the event ends.
```
**Note:**
1. `1 <= clips.length <= 100`
2. `0 <= clips[i][0], clips[i][1] <= 100`
3. `0 <= T <= 100`

## [#1046 Last Stone Weight](https://leetcode.com/problems/last-stone-weight)
We have a collection of stones, each stone has a positive integer weight.

Each turn, we choose the two **heaviest** stones and smash them together.  Suppose the stones have weights `x` and `y` with `x <= y`.  The result of this smash is:
- If `x == y`, both stones are totally destroyed;
- If `x != y`, the stone of weight `x` is totally destroyed, and the stone of weight `y` has new weight `y-x`.
At the end, there is at most 1 stone left.  Return the weight of this stone (or 0 if there are no stones left.)

**Example 1:**
```
Input: [2,7,4,1,8,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
We combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts to [2,4,1,1,1] then,
we combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,
we combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,
we combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts to [1] then that's the value of last stone.
```
**Note:**
1. `1 <= stones.length <= 30`
2. `1 <= stones[i] <= 1000`
